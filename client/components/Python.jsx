<h3>Python</h3>
  <p>I can confidently create HTML boilerplates and use advanced features such as tables, forms and grids. I use semantic 
      HTML and take care to indent tags to meet industry best practice. My current goal is to gain an improved awareness 
      of compability issues that arise on older devices and web browsers, and improve my HTML to provide those users with a 
      smooth experience.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to create HTML, CSS and Javascript static websites</li>
    <li>Awareness of compability issues with older technology and the importance of using alt tags.</li>
    <li>Keen to learn how to optimise search results with meta tags.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <blockquote>In summary: I'm confident with HTML and have an awareness of my strengths and weaknesses.</blockquote>
