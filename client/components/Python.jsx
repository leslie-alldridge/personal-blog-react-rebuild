          <p>
            At the moment, I'm learning the basics of Python. Machine learning
            is something I'm interested to delve into, so I can understand how
            exactly it works. I've created my own Jupyter Notebook{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/leslie-alldridge/python-linear-prediction-apple-share-price/blob/master/Apple%20Share%20Price%20-%20Linear%20Model.ipynb">
              (here)
            </a>{' '}
            that uses machine learning to predict the share price of Apple
            tomorrow. As the data was imported a few months back, it will be
            slightly outdated. I hope to use Pandas and learn how to import CSV
            files, so the alrogithm can do predictions based off the data
            imported.
