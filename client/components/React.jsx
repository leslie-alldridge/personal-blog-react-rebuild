          <h3>React &amp; Typescript</h3>
          <p>
            React is my favourite language on the web. I've always wanted to get
            better at React and build complex web apps with ease. I've completed
            multiple full-stack web applications using React and have expanded
            into Typescript recently. I'd love to learn how companies are taking
            React to the next level and how it's used in their scalable, highly
            reusable components.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I can confidently code full stack with React, Redux and
              Typescript.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've used ReactBootstrap, Sparklines, D3.js, ChartsJS and various
              other packages with React.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'd love to code within a complex React application and take my
              skills to the next level.

            In summary: React is one of my strongest languages and I look
            forward to seeing how companies are using it, so I can learn how to
            scale my code and make highly reusable components from others.
