        Hi there! First of all, thanks for checking out my portfolio.
        <p />
        My strongest skills are bringing energy into a team, finding more
        efficient ways to carry out repetitive tasks and thinking of creative
        solutions to a problem. Outside of the workplace, you'll find me at the
        gym, practising karate, solving rubik's cubes and learning something
        new.
        <p />
        I've finally found my passion after three careers. I'm driven to become
        a full stack developer and do the best work of my life. This career will
        offer me a place where I'll never master my role and be continually
        learning new technologies and stacks as the industry evolves.
        <p />
        At the moment I'm working in Technical Support for Xero and have
        completed a developer bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy. I'm eager to
        share my knowledge with my future team and learn from the best
        developers in the industry. <p />
        <p />I will bring a great customer awareness and quality of life focus
        to your team. I love thinking of big outside the box ideas and
        presenting in front of an audience. I'll frequently get drinks or do
        dishes for my team to set a good example of how a team should look after
        one another. I value honesty, caring for others, hard work and
        timeliness.
