          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            Javascript is the language of the web today. I've dedicated a lot of
            time into learning Javascript and how to overcome hurdles along the
            way. I enjoy participating in code challenges to exercise my lateral
            thinking. I find Javascript exciting as the language is continually
            evolving and my preferred syntax at the moment is ES6. I'd love to
            continue building my gists online to include more tips and tricks
            when using Javascript to complete everyday tasks more efficiently.

              Keen to delve into efficiency behind the scenes, so that my code
              uses minimal resources with respect to the large datasets the code
              will interact with.
