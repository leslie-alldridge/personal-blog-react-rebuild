          <p>
            Every application I've built has used Node JS. I'm able to write
            basic command line interfaces that wait for user interaction and
            load files using the FS filesystem.

              Ability to create full stack Web Applications in a Node
              environment

            <li>
              I'm currently looking into Go and Elixir to gain an understanding
              of the advantages/disadvantages of Node JS compared to other
              solutions.
            </li>

            In summary: My strength is using Node JS but I'm aware that
            alternatives exist. I'm a fast learner and not afraid to code on a
            different runtime environment.
